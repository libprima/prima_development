This is the arhiva of PRIMA (http://www.libprima.net). It contains the "norma" and "archiva" versions
of PRIMA. For tests and developments only.

norma: a directory containing a version that will be used as the reference version in the
development of the new version. "norma" is the Latin word for "standard".

archiva: a directory containing a collection of archived versions of the project, each of which
is a snapshot of the project together with the corresponding "norma" version. "archiva" is the
Latin word for "archives".
