1. Handle evaluation failures.
2. New options: fortran, precision, eta1/2, gamma1/2, iprint, maxhist, output_xhist, output_nlchist, maxfilt, ctol, cweight
   New output: xhist, nlcihist, nlcehist
   When debug = chckfunval = true, check the consistency between xhist, fhist, chist, nlcihist,
   nlcehist if they are available.
3. Compile/call different versions of the solvers according to precision and debug_flag.
4. New functions: evalobj.m, evalcon.m, cobyla_con, cobyla_funcon, all_solvers, all_precisions,
   all_variants.
5. Unify the signatures of the classical and modern version
6. gethuge, hugefun, and hugecon are renamed to getmax, funcmax, constrmax respectively.
   Add `boundmax`. Remove `hugenum`, which can be obtained by getmax('real', 'precision').
   getmax now accepts 'precision' as an input; implement maxint; call getmax only in preprima and
   maxint; call maxint only in preprima and lincoa, cobyla; record boundmax, funcmax, constrmax in
   probinfo and use them in postprima.
   update 20230207: getmax is now implemented in MATLAB; the Fortran version is removed.
7. No need to check maxint in uobyqa, newuoa, and bobyqa; in lincoa, cobyla, and preprima, only check
   that the number of variables/constraints do not exceed maxint.
8. Do not take the value of rhoend into consideration when correcting the incorrect (non-positive,
   not finite, etc) value of rhobeg for BOBYQA.
9. Check that chist is nonnegative.
10. If fhist contain any value blow -hugefun, raise the warning 'HugeNegativeF'.
11. "returns positive constrviolations" in the error messages should be "returns a positive
    constrviolation".

12. The warning 'uobyqa:UnivariateProblem' is only emitted for uobyqa when n <= 1 and classical = true,
    as the modernized version can handle n == 1.
    The warning message is modified as follows:
    wmsg = sprintf('%s: a univariate problem received and classical = true; %s may crash; classical is set to false.', funname, funname) "
    The modern version now can handle univariate problems properly, while the classical version may crash with memory errors.

13. (see line 248--271 of preprima.m, only in the bound/linear-constrained case) x0 is revised only
    if the preprocessing code find a new starting point with a smaller constraint violation. If x0
    is still infeasible (up to a tolerance, 10e-10 in the code) after the possible revision, then
    warn that "INVOKER: preprocessing code did not find a feasible x0; problem is likely infeasible",
    the warning identifier being "INVOKER:InfeasibleX0".

    At the same time, in lincoa.m (line 385--397), when x0 is infeasible (this x0 has been
    preprocessed), warn that "lincoa will modify the right-hand side of the constraints to make x0
    feasible.", the warning identifier being "lincoa:ConstraintModified". Originally, it warns about
    also the infeasibility of x0 (which has been warned in preprima.m now), with the warning
    identifier being "lincoa:InfeasibleX0".

Check other changes by comparing the matlab interfaces (vimdiff).
