***SEE ALSO: NORM***

Similar to NORM, the current implementation of HYPOTENUSE may be suboptimal due to improper or 
unnecessary scaling.

HYPOTENUSE is used in POWALG/QRADD_RDIAG and LINALG/QR;
QRADD_RDIAG is used in COBYLA/TRUSTREGION;
QR is used in LINALG/SOLVE, LINALG/INV, LINALG/PROJECT2, LINALG/LSQR_RDIAG, and
LINALG/LSQR_RDIAG is used in COBYLA/TRUSTREGION,
while SOLVE, INV, and PROJECT2 are not invoked in PRIMA.

Therefore, only COBYLA/TRUSTREGION is affected by HYPOTENUSE.
