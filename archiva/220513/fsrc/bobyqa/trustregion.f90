!
!     The arguments N, NPT, XPT, XOPT, GOPT, HQ, PQ, SL and SU have the same
!       meanings as the corresponding arguments of BOBYQB.
!     DELTA is the trust region radius for the present calculation, which
!       seeks a small value of the quadratic model within distance DELTA of
!       XOPT subject to the bounds on the variables.
!     XNEW will be set to a new vector of variables that is approximately
!       the ONE that minimizes the quadratic model within the trust region
!       subject to the SL and SU constraints on the variables. It satisfies
!       as equations the bounds that become active during the calculation.
!     D is the calculated trial step from XOPT, generated iteratively from an
!       initial value of zero. Thus XNEW is XOPT+D after the final iteration.
!     GNEW holds the gradient of the quadratic model at XOPT+D. It is updated
!       when D is updated.
!     XBDI is a working space vector. For I=1,2,...,N, the element XBDI(I) is
!       set to -1.0, 0.0, or 1.0, the value being nonzero if and only if the
!       I-th variable has become fixed at a bound, the bound being SL(I) or
!       SU(I) in the case XBDI(I)=-1.0 or XBDI(I)=1.0, respectively. This
!       information is accumulated during the construction of XNEW.
!     The arrays S, HS and HRED are also used for working space. They hold the
!       current search direction, and the changes in the gradient of Q along S
!       and the reduced D, respectively, where the reduced D is the same as D,
!       except that the components of the fixed variables are zero.
!     DSQ will be set to the square of the length of XNEW-XOPT.
!     CRVMIN is set to zero if D reaches the trust region boundary. Otherwise
!       it is set to the least curvature of H that occurs in the conjugate
!       gradient searches that are not restricted by any constraints. The
!       value CRVMIN=-ONE is set, however, if all of these searches are
!       constrained.
!
!     A version of the truncated conjugate gradient is applied. If a line
!     search is restricted by a constraint, then the procedure is restarted,
!     the values of the variables that are at their bounds being fixed. If
!     the trust region boundary is reached, then further changes may be made
!     to D, each ONE being in the two dimensional space that is spanned
!     by the current D and the gradient of Q at XOPT+D, staying on the trust
!     region boundary. Termination occurs when the reduction in Q seems to
!     be close to the greatest reduction that can be achieved.
!
!     Set some constants.
!
!
!     The sign of GOPT(I) gives the sign of the change to the I-th variable
!     that will reduce Q from its value at XOPT. Thus XBDI(I) shows whether
!     or not to fix the I-th variable at ONE of its bounds initially, with
!     NACT being set to the number of fixed variables. D and GNEW are also
!     set for the first iteration. DELSQ is the upper bound on the sum of
!     squares of the free variables. QRED is the reduction in Q so far.

! Reduce STPLEN if necessary in order to preserve the simple bounds, letting IACT be the index of
! the new constrained variable.
! Zaikun 20220422: Theory and computation differ considerably in the calculation of STPLEN and IACT.
! 1. Theoretically, the WHERE constructs can simplify (S > 0 .and. XTEST > SU) to (S > 0)
! and (S < 0, XTEST < SL) to (S < 0), which will be equivalent to Powell's original code. However,
! overflow will occur due to huge values in SU or SL that indicate the absence of bounds, and
! Fortran compilers will complain. It is not an issue in MATLAB/Python/Julia/R.
! 2. Theoretically, we can also simplify (S > 0 .and. XTEST > SU) to (XTEST > SU). This is because
! the algorithm intends to ensure that SL <= XSUM <= SU, under which the inequality XTEST(I) > SU(I)
! implies S(I) > 0. Numerically, however, XSUM may violate the bounds (slightly) due to rounding
! errors. If we replace (S > 0 .and. XTEST > SU) with (XTEST > SU), then SBOUND(I) will be -Inf when
! SU(I) - XSUM(I) is negative (although tiny) and S(I) is +0 (positively signed zero), which will
! lead to STPLEN = -Inf and IACT = I > 0. This will trigger a restart of the conjugate gradient
! method with DELSQ updated to DELSQ - D(IACT)**2; if D(IACT)**2 << DELSQ, then DELSQ can remain
! unchanged due to rounding, leading to an infinite cycling.
! 3. Theoretically, the WHERE construct corresponding to S > 0 can calculate SBOUND by
! MIN(STPLEN * S, SU - XSUM) / S instead of (SU - XSUM) / S, since this quotient matters only if it
! is less than STPLEN. The motivation is to avoid overflow even without checking XTEST > XU. However,
! such an implementation worsens the performance of BOBYQA significantly in our test on 20220422.
! Why? Note that the conjugate gradient method restarts when IACT > 0. Due to rounding errors,
! MIN(STPLEN * S, SU - XSUM) / S can frequently contain entries less than STPLEN, leading to a
! positive IACT and hence a restart. This turns out harmful to the performance of the algorithm (WHY?).
! It can be rectified in two ways: use MIN(STPLEN, (SU-XSUM) / S) instead of MIN(STPLEN*S, SU-XSUM)/S,
! or set IACT to a positive value only if the minimum of SBOUND is surely less STPLEN, e.g.
! ANY(SBOUND < (ONE-EPS) * STPLEN). The first method does not avoid overflow and makes little sense.

!STPLEN = MINVAL([STPLEN, SBOUND]) ! This line cannot be exchanged with the last
! We prefer our implementation, as the code is more explicit; in addition, it is more flexible: we
! can change the condition ANY(SBOUND < STPLEN) to ANY(SBOUND < (1 - EPS) * STPLEN) or
! ANY(SBOUND < (1 + EPS) * STPLEN), depending on whether we believe a false positive or a false
! negative of IACT > 0 is more harmful --- according to our test on 20220422, it is the former,

! Improve D by a sequential 2D search on the boundary of the trust region for the variables that
! have not reached a bound. See (3.6) of the BOBYQA paper and the elaborations nearby.
! 1. At each iteration, the current D is improved by a search conducted on the circular arch
! {D(THETA): D(THETA) = (I-P)*D + [COS(THETA)*P*D + SIN(THETA)*S], 0<=THETA<=PI/2, SL<=XOPT+D(THETA)<=SU},
! where P is the orthogonal projection onto the space of the variables that have not reached their
! bounds, and S is a linear combination of P*D and P*G(XOPT+D) with |S| = |P*D| and G(.) being the
! gradient of the quadratic model. The iteration is performed only if P*D and P*G(XOPT+D) are not
! nearly parallel. The arc lies in the hyperplane (I-P)*D + Span{P*D, P*G(XOPT+D)} and the trust
! region boundary {D: |D| = DELTA}; it is part of the circle (I-P)*D + {[COS(THETA)*P*D + SIN(THETA)*S]}
! with THETA being in [0, PI/2] and restricted by the bounds on X.
! 2. In (3.6) of the BOBYQA paper, Powell wrote that 0 <= THETA <= PI/4, which seems a typo.
! 3. The search on the arch is done by calling INTERVAL_MAX, which maximizes INTERVAL_FUN_TRSBOX.
! INTERVAL_FUN_TRSBOX is essentially Q(XOPT + D) - Q(XOPT + D(THETA)), but its independent variable
! is not THETA but TAN(THETA/2), namely "tangent of the half angle" as per Powell. This "half" may
! be the reason for the apparent typo mentioned above.
! Question (Zaikun 20220424): Shouldn't we try something similar in GEOSTEP?

! In Powell's code, MAXITER is essentially infinity; the loop will exit when NACT >= N - 1 or the
! procedure cannot significantly reduce the quadratic model. We impose an explicit but large bound
! on the number of iterations as a safeguard; in our tests, this bound is never reached.
