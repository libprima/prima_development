This directory contains simple examples that illustrate how to use the modernized Fortran
implementation of Powell's derivative-free optimization solvers.

N.B.:
1. See the Makefiles for how to compile the examples.
2. The examples assume that the macros in ../common/ppf.h are set to their default values. In
particular, PRIMA_REAL_PRECISION = 64 (double precision) and PRIMA_INTEGER_KIND = 0 (default integer).
