function verify(varargin)
%This function tests the modernized version of Powell's solver against Powell's version, verifying
% whether they produce the same results on CUTEst problems.
%
% Usage:
%
%   verify(solver, dimrange, nocompile_flag, sequential_flag, reverse_flag, problem_type, options)
%   verify(solver, problem, nocompile_flag, reverse_flag, problem_type, options)
%   verify(solve, problem, ir, nocompile_flag, reverse_flag, problem_type, options)
%
% where
% - `solver` is the name of the solver to test
% - `dimrange` is the vector [mindim, maxdim], or "small", or "big", or "large"
% - `problem` is the name of the problem to test
% - `ir` is the index of the random run in `isequiv`.
% - `nocompile_flag` is either 'nocompile' or 'ncp', indicating not to compile the solves
% - `sequential_flag` (optional) is either 'sequential' or 'seq', which means to test the problems sequentially
% - `reverse_flag` (optional) is either 'reverse' or 'rev', which means to test the solvers in the reverse order
% - `problem_type` can be any of {'u', 'b', 'l', 'n', 'ub', 'ubl', 'ubln', 'bl', 'bln', 'ln'},
%   indicating the problem type to test
