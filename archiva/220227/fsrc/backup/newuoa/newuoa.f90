!     This subroutine seeks the least value of a function of many variables,
!     by a trust region method that forms quadratic models by interpolation.
!     There can be some freedom in the interpolation conditions, which is
!     taken up by minimizing the Frobenius norm of the change to the second
!     derivative of the quadratic model, beginning with a zero matrix. The
!     arguments of the subroutine are as follows.
!
!     N must be set to the number of variables and must be at least two.
!     NPT is the number of interpolation conditions. Its value must be in the
!       interval [N+2,(N+1)(N+2)/2].
!     Initial values of the variables must be set in X(1),X(2),...,X(N). They
!       will be changed to the values that give the least calculated F.
!     RHOBEG and RHOEND must be set to the initial and final values of a trust
!       region radius, so both must be positive with RHOEND<=RHOBEG. Typically
!       RHOBEG should be about one tenth of the greatest expected change to a
!       variable, and RHOEND should indicate the accuracy that is required in
!       the final values of the variables.
!     The value of IPRINT should be set to 0, 1, 2 or 3, which controls the
!       amount of printing. Specifically, there is no output if IPRINT=0 and
!       there is output only at the return if IPRINT=1. Otherwise, each new
!       value of RHO is printed, with the best vector of variables so far and
!       the corresponding value of the objective function. Further, each new
!       value of F with its variables are output if IPRINT=3.
!     MAXFUN must be set to an upper bound on the number of calls of CALFUN.
!     The array W will be used for working space. Its length must be at least
!     (NPT+13)*(NPT+N)+3*N*(N+3)/2.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!     F is the objective function value when the algorithm exit.
!     INFO is the exit flag, which can be set to:
!       0: the lower bound for the trust region radius is reached.
!       1: the target function value is reached.
!       2: a trust region step has failed to reduce the quadratic model.
!       3: the objective function has been evaluated MAXFUN times.
!       4: much cancellation in a denominator.
!       5: NPT is not in the required interval.
!       6: one of the difference XU(I)-XL(I) is less than 2*RHOBEG.
!       7: rounding errors are becoming damaging.
!       8: rounding errors prevent reasonable changes to X.
!       9: the denominator of the updating formule is zero.
!       10: N should not be less than 2.
!       11: MAXFUN is less than NPT+1.
!       12: the gradient of constraint is zero.
!       -1: NaN occurs in x.
!       -2: the objective function returns a NaN or nearly infinite
!           value.

!
!     SUBROUTINE CALFUN (N,X,F) must be provided by the user. It must set F to
!     the value of the objective function for the variables X(1),X(2),...,X(N).
!
!     Partition the working space array, so that different parts of it can be
!     treated separately by the subroutine that performs the main calculation.

!     The above settings provide a partition of W for subroutine NEWUOB.
!     The partition requires the first NPT*(NPT+N)+5*N*(N+3)/2 elements of
!     W plus the space that is needed by the last array of NEWUOB.

! When the data is passed from the interfaces to the Fortran code, RHOBEG, 
! and RHOEND may change a bit (due to rounding ???). It was observed in
! a MATLAB test that MEX passed 1 to Fortran as 0.99999999999999978.
! If we set RHOEND = RHOBEG in the interfaces, then it may happen
! that RHOEND > RHOBEG. That is why we do the following. 
rhoend = min(rhobeg, rhoend)
