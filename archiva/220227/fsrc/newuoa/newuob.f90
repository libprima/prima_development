!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
! This subroutine performs the actual calculations of NEWUOA. The arguments IPRINT, MAXFUN, MAXHIST,
! NPT, ETA1, ETA2, FTARGET, GAMMA1, GAMMA2, RHOBEG, RHOEND, X, NF, F, FHIST, XHIST, and INFO are
! identical to the corresponding arguments in subroutine NEWUOA.
!
! XBASE holds a shift of origin that should reduce the contributions from rounding errors to values
! of the model and Lagrange functions.
! XOPT is the displacement from XBASE of the best vector of variables so far (i.e., the one provides
! the least calculated F so far). FOPT = F(XOPT + XBASE).
! D is reserved for trial steps from XOPT.
! [XPT, FVAL, KOPT] describes the interpolation set:
! XPT contains the interpolation points relative to XBASE, each COLUMN for a point; FVAL holds the
! However, there is a delay between the update of XOPT and KOPT. So they are not always consistent
! in the mid of an iteration. See the comment on the update of XOPT for details.
! values of F at the interpolation points; KOPT is the index of XOPT in XPT (XPT(:,KOPT) = XOPT).
! [GQ, HQ, PQ] describes the quadratic model: GQ will hold the gradient of the quadratic model at
! XBASE; HQ will hold the explicit second order derivatives of the quadratic model; PQ will contain
! the parameters of the implicit second order derivatives of the quadratic model.
! [BMAT, ZMAT, IDZ] describes the matrix H in the NEWUOA paper (eq. 3.12), which is the inverse of
! the coefficient matrix of the KKT system for the least-Frobenius norm interpolation problem:
! ZMAT will hold a factorization of the leading NPT*NPT submatrix of H, the factorization being
! ZMAT*Diag(DZ)*ZMAT^T with DZ(1:IDZ-1)=-1, DZ(IDZ:NPT-N-1)=1. BMAT will hold the last N ROWs of H
! except for the (NPT+1)th column. Note that the (NPT + 1)th row and (NPT + 1)th are not saved as
! they are unnecessary for the calculation.
!
! See Section 2 of the NEWUOA paper for more information about these variables.

        ! Test whether to replace the new quadratic model Q by the least-Frobenius norm interpolant
        ! Q_alt. Perform the replacement if certain criteria are satisfied.
        ! N.B.:
        ! 1. This part is OPTIONAL, but it is crucial for the performance on some problems. See
        ! Section 8 of the NEWUOA paper.
        ! 2. TRYQALT is called only after a trust-region step but not after a geometry step, maybe
        ! because the model is expected to be good after a geometry step.
        ! 3. If KNEW_TR = 0 after a trust-region step, TRYQALT is not invoked. In this case, the
        ! interpolation set is unchanged, so it seems reasonable to keep the model unchanged.
        ! 4. In theory, FVAL - FOPT in the call of TRYQALT can be replaced by FVAL + C with any
        ! constant C. This constant will not affect the result in precise arithmetic. Powell chose
        ! C = - FVAL(KOPT_OLD), where KOPT_OLD is the KOPT before the update above (Powell updated
        ! KOPT after TRYQALT). Here we use C = -FOPT, as it worked slightly better on CUTEst,
        ! although there is no difference theoretically. Note that FVAL(KOPT_OLD) may not equal
        ! FOPT_OLD --- it may happen that KNEW_TR = KOPT_OLD so that FVAL(KOPT_OLD) has been revised
        ! after the last function evaluation.
        ! 5. Question: Since TRYQALT is invoked only when DELTA equals the current RHO, why not
        ! reset ITEST to 0 when RHO is reduced?
        if (knew_tr > 0 .and. delta <= rho) then  ! DELTA = RHO.
            call tryqalt(idz, fval - fopt, ratio, bmat, zmat, itest, gq, hq, pq)
        end if
    end if  ! End of if (.NOT. SHORTD). The normal trust-region calculation ends here.


    !----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
    ! Before the next trust-region iteration, we may improve the geometry of XPT or reduce RHO
    ! according to IMPROVE_GEO and REDUCE_RHO_1/2. Now we decide these indicators.
    !----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!

    ! First define IMPROVE_GEO, which corresponds to Box 8 of the NEWUOA paper.
    ! The geometry of XPT likely needs improvement if the trust-region step bad --- either too short
    ! (SHORTD = TRUE) or the reduction ratio is small (RATIO < TENTH). However, if REDUCE_RHO_1 is
    ! TRUE, meaning that the step is short and the latest model errors have been small, then we do
    ! not need to improve the geometry; instead, RHO will be reduced.
    ! To improve the geometry of XPT, we will check whether the interpolation points are all close
    ! enough to the best point so far, i.e., all the points are within a ball centered at XOPT with
    ! a radius of 2*DELTA. If not, the farthest point will be replaced with a point selected by
    ! GEOSTEP, aiming to ameliorate the geometry of the interpolation set; if yes, then RHO will be
    ! reduced if MAX(DELTA, DNORM) <= RHO (if MAX(DELTA, DNORM) > RHO, then, as Powell mentioned
    ! under (2.3) of the NEWUOA paper, "RHO has not restricted the most recent choice of D", so it
    ! is not reasonable to reduce RHO).
    ! N.B.:
    ! 1. RATIO must be set even if SHORTD = TRUE. Otherwise, compilers will raise a run-time error.
    ! 2. If SHORTD = FALSE and KNEW_TR = 0, then IMPROVE_GEO = TRUE. Therefore, IMPROVE_GEO = TRUE
    ! if it is impossible to obtain a good XPT by replacing a current point with the one suggested
    ! by the trust-region step.
    ! 3. If REDUCE_RHO = FALSE and SHORTD = TRUE, then the trust-region step is not tried at all,
    ! i.e., no function evaluation is invoked at XOPT + D (when REDUCE_RHO = TRUE, the step is not
    ! tried either, but the same step will be generated again at the next trust-region iteration
    ! after RHO is reduced and DELTA is updated; see the end of Section 2 of the NEWUOA paper).
    ! 4. If SHORTD = FALSE and KNEW_TR = 0, then the trust-region step invokes a function evaluation
    ! at XOPT + D, but [XOPT + D, F(XOPT +D)] is not included into [XPT, FVAL]. In other words, this
    ! function value is discarded.
    ! 5. If SHORTD = FALSE and KNEW_TR > 0 and RATIO < TENTH, then [XPT, FVAL] is updated so that
    ! [XPT(KNEW_TR), FVAL(KNEW_TR)] = [XOPT + D, F(XOPT + D)], and the model is updated accordingly,
    ! but such a model will not be used in the next trust-region iteration, because a geometry step
    ! will be invoked to improve the geometry of the interpolation set and update the model again.
    ! 6. DELTA has been updated before arriving here: if REDUCE_RHO = FALSE and SHORTD = TRUE, then
    ! DELTA was reduced by a factor of 10; if SHORTD = FALSE, then DELTA was updated by TRRAD after
    ! the trust-region iteration.
    ! 7. If SHORTD = FALSE and KNEW_TR > 0, then XPT has been updated after the trust-region
    ! iteration; if RATIO > 0 in addition, then XOPT has been updated as well.

    xdist = sqrt(sum((xpt - spread(xopt, dim=2, ncopies=npt))**2, dim=1))
    ! KNEW_TR == 0 implies RATIO <= 0. Therefore, we can remove KNEW_TR == 0 from the definition
    ! of BAD_TRSTEP. Nevertheless, we keep it for robustness.
    bad_trstep = (shortd .or. ratio < TENTH .or. knew_tr == 0)  ! BAD_TRSTEP for IMPROVE_GEO
    improve_geo = ((.not. reduce_rho_1) .and. maxval(xdist) > TWO * delta .and. bad_trstep)

    ! If all the interpolation points are close to XOPT and the trust-region is small, but the
    ! trust-region step is "bad" (SHORTD or RATIO <= 0), then we shrink RHO (update the criterion
    ! for the "closeness" and SHORTD). REDUCE_RHO_2 corresponds to Box 10 of the NEWUOA paper.
    ! N.B.:
    ! 0. KNEW_TR == 0 implies RATIO <= 0. Therefore, we can remove KNEW_TR == 0 from the definition
    ! of BAD_TRSTEP. Nevertheless, we keep it for robustness.
    ! 1. The definition of REDUCE_RHO_2 is equivalent to the following:
    ! REDUCE_RHO_2 = (.NOT. IMPROVE_GEO) .AND. (MAX(DELTA, DNORM) <= RHO) .AND. BAD_TRSTEP
    ! 2. The definition of REDUCE_RHO_2 can be moved downward below IF (IMPROVE_GEO) ... END IF.
    ! Even though DNORM gets a new value after the geometry step when IMPROVE_GEO = TRUE, this
    ! value does not affect REDUCE_RHO_2, because DNORM comes into play only if IMPROVE_GEO = FALSE.
    ! 3. DELTA < DNORM may hold due to the update of DELTA.
    bad_trstep = (shortd .or. ratio <= 0 .or. knew_tr == 0)  ! BAD_TRSTEP for REDUCE_RHO_2
    reduce_rho_2 = (maxval(xdist) <= TWO * delta .and. max(delta, dnorm) <= rho .and. bad_trstep)

    ! Comments on BAD_TRSTEP:
    ! 1. Powell used different thresholds (<= 0 and < 0.1) for RATIO in the definitions of BAD_TRSTEP
    ! above. Unifying them to <= 0 makes little difference to the performance, sometimes worsening,
    ! sometimes improving, but never substantially; unifying them to 0.1 makes little difference to
    ! the performance either.
    ! Update 20220204: In the current version, unifying the two thresholds to 0 seems to worsen the
    ! performance on noise-free CUTEst problems with at most 200 variables; unifying them to 0.1
    ! worsens it a bit as well.
    ! 2. KNEW_TR == 0 implies RATIO <= 0, and hence BAD_TRSTEP = TRUE. Otherwise, SETDROP_TR is buggy.
