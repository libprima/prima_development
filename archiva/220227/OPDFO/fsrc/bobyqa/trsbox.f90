!
!     The arguments N, NPT, XPT, XOPT, GOPT, HQ, PQ, SL and SU have the same
!       meanings as the corresponding arguments of BOBYQB.
!     DELTA is the trust region radius for the present calculation, which
!       seeks a small value of the quadratic model within distance DELTA of
!       XOPT subject to the bounds on the variables.
!     XNEW will be set to a new vector of variables that is approximately
!       the one that minimizes the quadratic model within the trust region
!       subject to the SL and SU constraints on the variables. It satisfies
!       as equations the bounds that become active during the calculation.
!     D is the calculated trial step from XOPT, generated iteratively from an
!       initial value of zero. Thus XNEW is XOPT+D after the final iteration.
!     GNEW holds the gradient of the quadratic model at XOPT+D. It is updated
!       when D is updated.
!     XBDI is a working space vector. For I=1,2,...,N, the element XBDI(I) is
!       set to -1.0, 0.0, or 1.0, the value being nonzero if and only if the
!       I-th variable has become fixed at a bound, the bound being SL(I) or
!       SU(I) in the case XBDI(I)=-1.0 or XBDI(I)=1.0, respectively. This
!       information is accumulated during the construction of XNEW.
!     The arrays S, HS and HRED are also used for working space. They hold the
!       current search direction, and the changes in the gradient of Q along S
!       and the reduced D, respectively, where the reduced D is the same as D,
!       except that the components of the fixed variables are zero.
!     DSQ will be set to the square of the length of XNEW-XOPT.
!     CRVMIN is set to zero if D reaches the trust region boundary. Otherwise
!       it is set to the least curvature of H that occurs in the conjugate
!       gradient searches that are not restricted by any constraints. The
!       value CRVMIN=-1.0D0 is set, however, if all of these searches are
!       constrained.
!
!     A version of the truncated conjugate gradient is applied. If a line
!     search is restricted by a constraint, then the procedure is restarted,
!     the values of the variables that are at their bounds being fixed. If
!     the trust region boundary is reached, then further changes may be made
!     to D, each one being in the two dimensional space that is spanned
!     by the current D and the gradient of Q at XOPT+D, staying on the trust
!     region boundary. Termination occurs when the reduction in Q seems to
!     be close to the greatest reduction that can be achieved.
!
!     Set some constants.
!
half = 0.5D0
one = 1.0D0
zero = 0.0D0
!
!     The sign of GOPT(I) gives the sign of the change to the I-th variable
!     that will reduce Q from its value at XOPT. Thus XBDI(I) shows whether
!     or not to fix the I-th variable at one of its bounds initially, with
!     NACT being set to the number of fixed variables. D and GNEW are also
!     set for the first iteration. DELSQ is the upper bound on the sum of
!     squares of the free variables. QRED is the reduction in Q so far.
