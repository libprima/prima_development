!     Test problem for BOBYQA, the objective function being the sum of
!     the reciprocals of all pairwise distances between the points P_I,
!     I=1,2,...,M in two dimensions, where M=N/2 and where the components
!     of P_I are X(2*I-1) and X(2*I). Thus each vector X of N variables
!     defines the M points P_I. The initial X gives equally spaced points
!     on a circle. Four different choices of the pairs (N,NPT) are tried,
!     namely (10,16), (10,21), (20,26) and (20,41). Convergence to a local
!     minimum that is not global occurs in both the N=10 cases. The details
!     of the results are highly sensitive to computer rounding errors. The
!     choice IPRINT=2 provides the current X and optimal F so far whenever
!     RHO is reduced. The bound constraints of the problem require every
!     component of X to be in the interval [-1,1].
