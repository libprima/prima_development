Here are points to note when translating the Fortran code to other languages.

1. Row- and column-major order.

   Fortran saves matrices in the column-major order.

   Same: MATLAB, Julia, R.
   Different: NumPy, C/C++.

2. Initial index.

   In the Fortran code, array indices start from 1.

   Same: MATLAB, Julia, R.
   Different: Python, C/C++.

3. Argument-passing by reference, by value, or by sharing.

   Fortran subroutines/functions passes augments by reference. Hence
   changes made to an argument within a subroutine is visible to the caller.

   Call by value: MATLAB, C/C++, R
   Call by sharing: Julia, Python

4. Row and column vectors.

   In Fortran, there is no difference between row vectors and column vectors.
   They are both represented as 1D arrays.

   MATLAB can differentiate rows and columns because they are indeed
   considered as matrices --- in other words, there is no real 1D array
   or scalar in MATLAB; they are all matrices.

   Consequently, Fortran and MATLAB behave differently in the following aspects.

   4.1. In Fortran, when a vector x multiplies a matrix A by the intrinsic
   function MATMUL, there are two possibilities:
   - matmul(A, x): x is a 1D array whose length is size(A, 2); the result
     is a 1D array whose length is size(A, 1).
   - matmul(x, A): x is a 1D array whose length is size(A, 1); the result
     is a 1D array whose length is size(A, 2)

   In MATLAB, if x is a column vector, and A is a matrix, then A*x in is
   similar to matmul(A, x) in Fortran if the length of x equals size(A, 2),
   and x'*A is similar to matmul(x, A) in Fortran if the length of x equals
   size(A, 1).

   4.2. In Fortran, two arrays x and y can be added up as long as they
   have the same size, the result being an array of the same size.

   In MATLAB, if x is a column vector while y is a row vector, then x+y
   is a matrix of size [length(x), length(y)], the (i, j) entry being
   x(i)+y(j). In Fortran, the same matrix can be obtain in Fortran by
   spread(x, copies=size(y), dim=2) + spread(y, copies=size(x), dim=1).

5. Multiplication of arrays.

   In Fortran, x*y means the entry-wise multiplication of two arrays
   x and y, where the two arrays should have the same size. Matrix
   multiplication is done by MATMUL. Similarly, A**n calculates the
   entry-wise power of A.

   Same: numpy
   Different: MATLAB, Julia, where * means matrix multiplication, and A^2
   in MATLAB is matmul(A, A).


6. The "size" intrinsic function in Fortran.

   In Fortran:
   - size(x) returns the TOTAL number of elements in an array x, no matter
   whether x is 1D, 2D, or multidimensional. size(x) is invalid if x is a scalar.
   - size(x, 1) returns the size of x along the first dimension (i.e.,
   number of rows); size(x, 2) returns the size along the second dimension (i.e.,
   number of columns); size(x, k) is invalid if k is larger than the
   number of dimensions that x has (hence size(x, 2) is invalid is x is
   a vector).

   In MATLAB:
   - size(x) returns a row vector containing the size of x along
   all its dimensions; in addition, all scalars and vectors are indeed
   considered as matrices; therefore, for a scalar x, size(x) = [1, 1];
   for a row vector x, size(x) = [1, length(x)]; for a column vector,
   size(x) = [length(x), 1].
   - The behavior of size(x, k) is the same as in Fortran, except that
   there is no constraint on k; when k is larger than the number of
   dimensions in x, size(x, k) = 1.
   - For the size(x) in Fortran, the equivalent expressions in MATLAB are:
   -- when x is a 1D array, length(x);
   -- general arrays: numel(x).

7. maxval/minval

   In Fortran:
   If A is a matrix, then maxval(A) returns the largest element of A;
   maxval(A, DIM) operates down the dimension DIM of A. For example, any(A,1) operates down the
   first dimension (the rows) of A, taking the maximum of each column of A.
   max(a1, a2, a3, ...) returns the largest one among a1, a2, a3, ...


   In MATLAB:
   If A is a matrix, then max(A) returns a row vector, each entry being the largest element of the
   corresponding column of A.
   max(A, [], DIM) operates down the dimension DIM of A, which is the same as maxval(A, DIM) in
   Fortran. For example, max(A, [], 1) operates down the first dimension (the rows) of A, taking the
   maximum of each column of A, which is equivalent to the MATLAB version of max(A).
   max(A, 'all') returns the maximum of all the elements of A.
   C = MAX(X,Y) returns an array with the largest elements taken from X or Y. X and Y must have
   compatible sizes. In the simplest cases, they can be the same size or one can be a scalar. Two
   inputs have compatible sizes if, for every dimension, the dimension sizes of the inputs are
   either the same or one of them is 1.


   minval is similar.


   maxloc/minloc:

   In Fortran, minloc(A, mask=MASK) returns the location of the minimum of A subject to the MASK.
   MASK is a boolean array of the same shape as A, and only the elements of A corresponding to
   MASK = .TRUE. are considered. By default, the first location will be returned if there are
   multiple.

   In MATLAB, for a 1D array A, the same thing can be done by
   minimum = min(A(MASK));
   minloc = min(find(A<=minimum));
   Note that A<=minimum is equivalent to A==minimum. We use <= instead of == to avoid equality
   comparison of real numbers.
   The min function in MATLAB can return the location of the minimum, but it does NOT support mask.

   MIN/MAX involving NaN
   The Fortran standard does not specify what the result of the MAX and MIN intrinsics are if one of
   the arguments is a NaN. In other words, such the result is unpredictable.
   In Fortran, MINLOC(X) may return 0 if X contains NaN; with Gfrotran, if X is a vector containing
   only NaN, then MINLOC(X) = 0, but it needs not to be the case with other languages and/or
   compilers. Since this value can be 0, using it as the index of an array may lead to memory errors.


8. any/all

   In Fortran:
   If A is a boolean matrix, then any(A) returns the disjunction of all the elements of A.
   any(A, DIM) operates down the dimension DIM of A. For example, any(A,1) operates down the first
   dimension (the rows) of A, taking the disjunction of each column of A.

   In MATLAB:
   If A is a boolean matrix, then any(A) returns a row vector, each entry being the disjunction of
   the corresponding column of A.
   any(A, DIM) operates down the dimension DIM of A, which is the same as in Fortran. For example,
   any(A,1) operates down the first dimension (the rows) of A, taking the disjunction of each column
   of A, which is equivalent to the MATLAB version of any(A) .
   any(A, 'all') returns the disjunction of all the elements of A (so it is the same as the Fortran
   version of any(A)).

   all (conjunction) is similar.

9. sum

   In Fortran:
   If A is a matrix, then sum(A) returns the sum of all the elements in A.
   sum(A, DIM) operates down the dimension DIM of A. For example, sum(A,1) operates down the first
   dimension (the rows) of A, taking the sum of each column of A.

   In MATLAB:
   If A is a matrix, then sum(A) returns a row vector, each entry being the sum of the corresponding
   column of A.
   sum(A, DIM) operates down the dimension DIM of A, which is the same as in Fortran. For example,
   sum(A,1) operates down the first dimension (the rows) of A, taking the sum of each column of A,
   which is equivalent to the MATLAB version of sum(A) .
   sum(A, 'all') returns the sum of all the elements of A (so it is the same as the Fortran version
   of sum(A)).

10. array constructor and reshape

   Suppose that A is a matrix of size mXn and B of size mXk.

   In Fortran:
   [A, B] is a VECTOR of length m*n+m*k; it equals
   [A(:, 1), A(:, 2), ..., A(:, n), B(:, 1), B(:, 2), ..., B(:, k)]
   If we want a mX(n+k) matrix, the first n columns being A and the last k columns being B, we need
   reshape([A, B], m, n+k)

   In MATLAB:
   [A, B] is a matrix of size mX(n+k), the first n columns being A and the last k columns being B,
   which is the same as reshape([A, B], m, n+k) in Fortran.

11. Vector subscript

    A 1-D array X can be indexed by a vector of integers I (namely, A(I)) provided that
    1) the entries in I are pairwise distinct
    2) the entries of I all lie between the declared bounds for the indices of A.

    Pay attention to 1). According to Fortran standard 2018, If a vector subscript has two or more
    elements with the same value, an array section with that vector subscript is not definable and
    shall not be defined or become undefined.

12. WHERE ... ELSEWHERE construct

    Suppose that X, Y, Z, and B are arrays of the same shape, and B is boolean. Then Fortran supports

    where (B)
        X = Y
    elsewhere
        X = Z
    end where

    for which the MATLAB equivalent is

    X(B) = Y(B)
    X(~B) = Z(~B)
