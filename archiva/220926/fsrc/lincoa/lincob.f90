!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
! This subroutine performs the actual calculations of LINCOA.
!
! The arguments IPRINT, MAXFILT, MAXFUN, MAXHIST, NPT, CTOL, CWEIGHT, ETA1, ETA2, FTARGET, GAMMA1,
! GAMMA2, RHOBEG, RHOEND, X, NF, F, XHIST, FHIST, CHIST, CSTRV and INFO are identical to the
! corresponding arguments in subroutine LINCOA.
! AMAT is a matrix whose columns are the constraint gradients, scaled so that they have unit length.
! B contains on entry the right hand sides of the constraints, scaled as above, but later B is
! modified for variables relative to XBASE.
! XBASE holds a shift of origin that should reduce the contributions from rounding errors to values
! of the model and Lagrange functions.
! XPT contains the interpolation point coordinates relative to XBASE.
! FVAL holds the values of F at the interpolation points.
! XSAV holds the best feasible vector of variables so far, without any shift of origin.
! XOPT is set to XSAV-XBASE, which is the displacement from XBASE of the feasible vector of variables
! that provides the least calculated F so far, this vector being the current trust region centre.
! GOPT holds the gradient of the quadratic model at XSAV = XBASE+XOPT.
! HQ holds the explicit second derivatives of the quadratic model.
! PQ contains the parameters of the implicit second derivatives of the quadratic model.
! BMAT holds the last N columns of the big inverse matrix H.
! ZMAT holds the factorization of the leading NPT by NPT submatrix of H, this factorization being
! ZMAT * Diag(DZ) * ZMAT^T, where the elements of DZ are plus or minus ONE, as specified by IDZ.
! D is employed for trial steps from XOPT.
! XNEW is the displacement from XBASE of the vector of variables for the current calculation of F,
! except that SUBROUTINE TRSTEP uses it for working space.
! IACT is an integer array for the indices of the active constraints.
! RESCON holds useful information about the constraint residuals. Every nonnegative RESCON(J) is the
! residual of the J-th constraint at the current trust region centre. Otherwise, if RESCON(J) is
! negative, the J-th constraint holds as a strict inequality at the trust region centre, its
! residual being at least |RESCON(J)|; further, the value of |RESCON(J)| is at least the current
! trust region radius DELTA.
! QFAC is the orthogonal part of the QR factorization of the matrix of active constraint gradients,
! these gradients being ordered in accordance with IACT. When NACT is less than N, columns are added
! to QFAC to complete an N by N orthogonal matrix, which is important for keeping calculated steps
! sufficiently close to the boundaries of the active constraints.
! RFAC is the upper triangular part of this QR factorization, beginning with the first diagonal
! element, followed by the two elements in the upper triangular part of the second column and so on.

        ! Although very rarely, with the original code, an infinite loop can occur in the following
        ! scenario. Suppose that, at an certain iteration, KNEW = 0, DNORM > 0.5*DELTA > RHO, QRED
        ! <= 0, and sum_{K=1}^NPT ||XPT(K,:)-XOPT(:)||^2 < DELTA^2 (i.e., DELTA is large and DNORM
        ! is not small, yet QRED <= 0 due to rounding errors and XPT are not far from XOPT). Then
        ! the program will goto 530 (try whether to improve the geometry) and then cycle, where
        ! XBASE may be shifted to the current best point, in the hope of reducing rounding errors
        ! and 'improve' the model. Afterwards, another trust region step is produced by the
        ! 'improved' model. Note that DELTA remains unchanged in this process. If the new trust
        ! region step turns out to satisfy DNORM > 0.5*DELTA and QRED <= 0 again (i.e., the
        ! 'improved' model still suffers from rounding errors), then the program will goto 530 and
        ! then cycle, where shifting will not happen because either XBASE was already shifted to the
        ! current best point in last step, or XBASE is close to the current best point.
        ! Consequently, the model will remain unchanged, and produce the same trust region step
        ! again. This leads to an infinite loop. The infinite loop did happen when the MATLAB
        ! interface was applied to min atan(x+100) s.t. x<=-99 (x0=-99, npt=3, rhobeg=1,
        ! rhoend=1e-6). The problem does not exist in NEWUOA or BOBYQA, where the program will exit
        ! immediately when QRED <= 0. To prevent such a loop, here we use IMPROVE_GEO to record
        ! whether the path 530 --> 20 has already happened for last trust region step. IMPROVE_GEO
        ! implies that last trust region step satisfies QRED <= 0 and followed 530 --> 20. With
        ! IMPROVE_GEO = TRUE, if QRED is again nonnegative for the new trust region step, we should
