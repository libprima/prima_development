When the MATLAB version is implemented (e.g., newuoa_mat), we may remove the 'matlab/interfaces/' directory,
and put its content directly below matlab/

20230108: put the MEX files under newuoa_for, and name them ast newuoa_for_dgm, etc? What about gethuge?
githuge is used only in preprima and maxint, the latter again only used in preprima.

Make newuoa etc unavailable to the end users. (?)
